# KERN

[NB: Original README can be found below](#knowledge-embedded-routing-network-for-scene-graph-generation)

**News: I have merged the PR from @AU-Nebula that (hopefully) make it easier to set up and run.**


## Install KERN for the first time
The current KERN implementation relies on CUDA 9.0 which, unfortunately, is an older version that does not run on more recent operating systems.
Regardless of your operating system's support for CUDA 9.0, begin with the following steps:

 1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yuweihao/KERN.git`.
 2. Change directory: `cd KERN`.
 3. Run: `sh kern_setup.sh`. There are quite some data to download, so this step will take a while. The script assumes that Docker and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker) are installed on the system.
 4. Activate the Conda environment: `conda activate kern`.
 5. Compile the CUDA part of the project: `sh compile.sh`.
 6. Generate knowledge matrices (statistical prior): `python prior_matrices/generate_knowledge.py`.
 7. Test KERN processing by running Validation task with VG dataset: `python models/eval_rels.py -ckpt checkpoints/kern_sgdet.tar`.

## Run KERN with custom images

 1. Run: `docker run -it -v $PWD:/kern --gpus all cuda9`.
 2. Upload custom dataset to `/data/custom_images`.
 3. Run: `sh scripts/eval_kern_sgdet.sh`.

### Work in progress: 
 * Create visualization script for Custom Dataset

# Setup
In our paper, our model's strong baseline model is [SMN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06640) (Stacked Motif Networks) introduced by [@rowanz](https://github.com/rowanz) et al. To compare these two models fairly, the PyTorch version code of our model is based on [@rowanz](https://github.com/rowanz)'s code [neural-motifs](https://github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs). Thank [@rowanz](https://github.com/rowanz) for sharing his nice code to research community.

0. Install python3.6 and pytorch 3. I recommend the [Anaconda distribution](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/). To install PyTorch if you haven't already, use
 ```conda install pytorch=0.3.0 torchvision=0.2.0 cuda90 -c pytorch```.
 We use [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) to observe the results of validation dataset. If you want to use it in PyTorch, you should install TensorFlow and [tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) first. If you don't want to use TensorBaord, just not use the command ```-tb_log_dir```.
 
1. Update the config file with the dataset paths. Specifically:
    - Visual Genome (the VG_100K folder, image_data.json, VG-SGG.h5, and VG-SGG-dicts.json). See data/stanford_filtered/README.md for the steps to download these.
    - You'll also need to fix your PYTHONPATH: `export PYTHONPATH=/home/yuweihao/exp/KERN`

2. Compile everything. Update your CUDA path in Makefile file and run `make` in the main directory: this compiles the Bilinear Interpolation operation for the RoIs.

3. Pretrain VG detection. To compare our model with [neural-motifs](https://github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs) fairly, we just use their pretrained VG detection. [You can download their pretrained detector checkpoint provided by @rowanz.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11zKRr2OF5oclFL47kjFYBOxScotQzArX) 
You could also run ./scripts/pretrain_detector.sh to train detector by yourself. Note: You might have to modify the learning rate and batch size according to number and memory of GPU you have.

4. Generate knowledge matrices: ```python prior_matrices/generate_knowledge.py```, or download them from here: prior_matrices (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tg4CtK8Y1JkSsuaLWIqwzIrp6VXd11JP" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!ArFSFaZzVErwgUNM6nitaMleGkxW" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>).

5. Train our KERN model. There are three training phase. You need a GPU with 12G memory. 
    - Train VG relationship predicate classification: run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=YOUR_GPU_NUM ./scripts/train_kern_predcls.sh``` 
    This phase maybe last about 20-30 epochs. 
    - Train scene graph classification: run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=YOUR_GPU_NUM ./scripts/train_kern_sgcls.sh```. Before run this script, you need to modify the path name of best checkpoint you trained in precls phase: ```-ckpt checkpoints/kern_predcls/vgrel-YOUR_BEST_EPOCH_RNUM.tar```. It lasts about 8-13 epochs, then you can decrease the learning rate to 1e-6 to further improve the performance. Like neural-motifs, we use only one trained checkpoint for both predcls and sgcls tasks. You can also download our checkpoint here: kern_sgcls_predcls.tar (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F2WBSGRHmJD9K1LT8ImkGOCuZraood21" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!ArFSFaZzVErwgUKVN85N17rMEXME" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>).
    - Refine for detection: run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=YOUR_GPU_NUM ./scripts/train_kern_sgdet.sh``` or download the checkpoint here: kern_sgdet.tar (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hAx4MpMiwofABQi9H6_Jb0Qjp016JX7T" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!ArFSFaZzVErwgUKVN85N17rMEXME" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>). If you find the validation performance plateaus, you could also decrease learning rate to 1e-6 to improve performance. 

6. Evaluate: refer to the scripts ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=YOUR_GPU_NUM ./scripts/eval_kern_[predcls/sgcls/sgdet].sh```. You can conveniently find all our checkpoints, evaluation caches and results in this folder KERN_Download (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yCQfZRCt6UF-C-jSq78NaF9IUyNplLFx" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!ArFSFaZzVErwgT_SvqLZ3sv5XDu-" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>).



# Evaluation metrics
In validation/test dataset, assume there are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y" />  images. For each image, a model generates top <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X" /> predicted relationship triplets. As for image <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{y}" />, there are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_{y}" /> ground truth relationship triplets, where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T_{y}^{X}" /> triplets are predicted successfully by the model. We can calculate:


<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R@X=\frac{1}{Y}\sum_{y=1}^{Y}\frac{T_{y}^{X}}{G_{y}}." />


For image <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{y}" />, in its <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_{y}" /> ground truth relationship triplets, there are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_{yk}" /> ground truth triplets with relationship <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k" /> (Except <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k=1" />, meaning no relationship. The number of relationship classes is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K" />, including no relationship), where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T_{yk}^X" /> triplets are predicted successfully by the model. In <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y" /> images of validation/test dataset, for relationship <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k" />, there are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y_{k}" /> images which contain at least one ground truth triplet with this relationship. The R@X of relationship <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k" /> can be calculated:


<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R@X_k=\frac{1}{Y_k}\sum_{y=1,G_{yk}\neq0}^{Y}\frac{T_{yk}^X}{G_{yk}}." />



Then we can calculate:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mR@X=\frac{1}{K-1}\sum_{k=2}^{K}R@X_k." />
